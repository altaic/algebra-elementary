## What is this?

A haskell package for all your symbolic elementary algebra needs! It currently provides an algebraic expression AST, simplification via rewriting, and a test-suite. Complete with haddock documentation.

## Coming soon...

* AST annotations
* pretty-printers (Latex, Mathematica, SageMath, etc.) and parsers
* full computation/solving
* trigonometric functions
* summations
* products
